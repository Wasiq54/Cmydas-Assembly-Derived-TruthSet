**##Trimming**
Five widely used read-preprocessing tools were evaluated for quality and adapter trimming of Chelonia mydas paired-end Illumina NovaSeq reads (151 bp). All runs were performed using 20 threads on a high-performance workstation (Intel Xeon, 512 GB RAM, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).

Tool Versions and Sources:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. fastp v0.26.0 — OpenGene GitHub
   Fast, all-in-one trimmer with automatic adapter detection, base correction, and per-sample JSON/HTML QC reports (released August 2024).

2. Trimmomatic v0.39 — Trimmomatic GitHub
   Standard Java-based trimmer using sliding-window and adapter clipping; stable release since 2019.

3. BBDuk (BBMap suite) v39.01 — BBMap SourceForge
   Adapter and quality trimming based on k-mer matching; included in BBTools v39.01 (February 2024).

4. Trim Galore! v0.6.8 — Babraham Bioinformatics
   Wrapper around Cutadapt; performs quality trimming and adapter removal (December 2023).

5. Cutadapt v5.2 — Bioconda / GitHub
   Python-based adapter trimmer supporting multithreading (released 2025; Python 3.12 compatible).
------------------------------------------------------------

Workflow and Rationale
All five trimmers were applied to both the normal (CH-NORMS1) and abnormal (Ab-NormS2) datasets to compare performance in adapter removal, read retention, and GC content preservation.
Among them, fastp (v0.26.0) demonstrated the best overall balance of speed, accuracy, and comprehensive reporting. Therefore, fastp-trimmed reads were selected for all downstream analyses, including alignment, variant calling, and benchmarking.

The exact shell commands and parameters for each tool are provided in:
scripts/commands_trimming_all_tools.txt

Quality improvements were confirmed using FastQC (v0.11.9) and summarized with MultiQC (v1.15) after trimming.





## Alignment (examples)

Alignment
------------------------------------------------------------
Three mappers were evaluated for read alignment against the Chelonia mydas reference genome (rCheMyd1.pri.v2):
1. BWA-MEM v0.7.17
2. Bowtie2 v2.5.4
3. Minimap2 v2.28

Each aligner was executed using 15–40 threads on paired-end 151 bp Illumina NovaSeq reads.
Outputs were sorted and indexed with Samtools (v1.22.1).

Exact shell commands are provided in

scripts/commands_alignment.txt.

Mapping quality was evaluated using Samtools flagstat and alignment summary metrics.







Variant Calling
------------------------------------------------------------
Five variant calling tools were used to detect SNPs and indels from BWA-MEM–aligned reads:
DeepVariant v1.9.0, GATK v4.6.2.0, FreeBayes v1.3.10, VarScan v2.4.6, and BCFtools v1.22.
Each tool was executed on both normal and abnormal Chelonia mydas datasets using the same reference genome (rCheMyd1.pri.v2).
Command-line parameters for reproducibility are provided in 

scripts/commands_variant_calling.txt.

**Variant Calling then filtering**  


Variants were retained if they:
(i) passed the caller’s internal filters (FILTER=PASS or “.”),
(ii) had alternate allele depth (AD) greater than 3, and
(iii) had variant allele frequency (VAF) above 2%.
Variants not meeting these criteria were removed.

Variants were filtered to retain only those with FILTER=PASS/., AD > 3, and VAF > 0.02.


(FILTER="PASS" or ".")
AND
ALT depth > 3
AND
VAF > 0.02)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jaccard similarity Normal SNPs

Jaccard similarity analysis of SNP calls from the normal dataset showed a consistently high level of agreement among the five variant callers. DeepVariant, GATK, BCFtools and VarScan exhibited the strongest similarity scores, while FreeBayes showed comparatively lower but still substantial overlap. Overall, the normal‐sample SNP concordance indicates strong cross-caller consistency in high-confidence SNP regions.

command 

https://github.com/Wasiq54/Chelonia-mydas-variant-benchmark/blob/main/scripts/normal_snp_jaccard.sh

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jaccard similarity abnormal SNPs
In the abnormal dataset, SNP-level Jaccard similarities followed a pattern similar to the normal sample. DeepVariant, GATK, BCFtools and VarScan again demonstrated strong mutual overlap, whereas FreeBayes maintained moderate similarity values. The abnormal sample displayed slightly reduced inter-caller similarity compared to the normal dataset, likely reflecting biological differences or coverage variation, but overall SNP concordance remained high

command

https://github.com/Wasiq54/Chelonia-mydas-variant-benchmark/blob/main/scripts/abnormal_snp_jaccard.sh

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jaccard similarity Normal Indel
Jaccard similarity for INDELs in the normal dataset was lower than for SNPs, consistent with known challenges in INDEL calling. DeepVariant and GATK shared the highest INDEL concordance, followed by BCFtools and VarScan, whereas FreeBayes showed the lowest similarity with the other callers. These patterns align with previously reported INDEL-calling inconsistencies across tools.

command 
https://github.com/Wasiq54/Chelonia-mydas-variant-benchmark/blob/main/scripts/normal_indel_jaccard.sh


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jaccard similarity abnormal Indel

The abnormal dataset exhibited similar INDEL concordance patterns to the normal dataset, with DeepVariant and GATK forming the most consistent pair. Overall Jaccard values for INDELs were modest, reflecting typical inter-caller variability for small insertions and deletions. FreeBayes again showed weaker similarity to the remaining tools, while BCFtools and VarScan showed intermediate concordance.

command
https://github.com/Wasiq54/Chelonia-mydas-variant-benchmark/blob/main/scripts/abnormal_indel_jaccard.sh


---------------------------------------------------- For Venn SNP diagram------------------------------------------------
Venn diagrams were generated to compare the overlap of SNP calls among the five variant calling tools (DeepVariant, GATK, FreeBayes, VarScan, and BCFtools). SNPs were extracted from each filtered VCF using bcftools view, and unique variant identifiers (CHROM:POS:REF:ALT) were obtained using bcftools query. These variant sets were then imported into R, and multi-set Venn diagrams were constructed using the ggVennDiagram package to visualize shared and unique variants across tools
command 
https://github.com/Wasiq54/Chelonia-mydas-variant-benchmark/blob/main/venn_analysis/venn_plot_abnormal.R
https://github.com/Wasiq54/Chelonia-mydas-variant-benchmark/blob/main/venn_analysis/venn_plot_abnormal.R








### Venn Diagram Visualization of Variant Callers

To assess concordance among the five variant callers (DeepVariant, GATK, FreeBayes, VarScan, and BCFtools), SNP positions were extracted from normalized and sorted VCF files using **bcftools** and compared visually through 5-way Venn diagrams.  

The pipeline involved:
1. Normalization and indexing of VCFs using `bcftools norm`, `bcftools sort`, and `bcftools index`.
2. Extraction of SNP coordinates (`CHROM:POS`) from each caller using `bcftools query`.
3. Visualization of overlapping SNPs using the **ggVennDiagram** (R v1.3.2) package.

Scripts for complete reproducibility are available in the `venn_analysis/` directory:
- `venn_pipeline.sh` — generates normalized SNP coordinate files.  
- `venn_plot_normal.R` — visualizes overlap for the normal dataset.  
- `venn_plot_abnormal.R` — visualizes overlap for the abnormal dataset.  

The resulting figures (`FiveTool_Venn_Normal.png` and `FiveTool_Venn_Abnormal.png`) illustrate shared and unique variant calls among the tools for each dataset.


### Discordance Analysis (Missed and Unique Variants)

To evaluate discordance among variant callers, a Python-based script was developed to identify **missed** and **unique** SNPs across the five tools (DeepVariant, GATK, FreeBayes, VarScan, and BCFtools).  
The analysis used the SNP coordinate text files generated during the Venn diagram pipeline (`*_SNPs.txt`) for both normal and abnormal datasets.

**Workflow Summary**
1. Each SNP coordinate (`CHROM:POS`) was loaded from the tool-specific SNP files.
2. A combined union of all SNPs was generated.
3. For each caller:
   - **Missed SNPs** were defined as variants detected by all other tools but absent in the current one.  
   - **Unique SNPs** were defined as variants detected exclusively by that tool.
4. Counts of missed and unique SNPs were summarized per caller.

The script (`discordance_analysis.py`) is located in the `venn_analysis/` directory and can be executed as:
```bash
python venn_analysis/discordance_analysis.py






## Consensus Truth Set & Benchmarking

High-confidence variant truth sets were generated by intersecting five callers (DeepVariant, GATK, FreeBayes, VarScan, BCFtools) for normal (CH-NORMS1) and abnormal (Ab-NormS2) datasets.  

**Steps:**
1. Sort, index, and normalize VCFs using bcftools.
2. Create intersections (3+, 4+, 5+) with bcftools isec.
3. Filter caller VCFs to consensus loci using bcftools view -R.
4. Generate RTG reference SDF:
   rtg format -o reference.sdf <reference.fasta>
5. Benchmark each caller using RTG vcfeval:
   rtg vcfeval -b <truth.vcf.gz> -c <caller.vcf.gz> -t reference.sdf -o <out_dir> --vcf-score-field QUAL
