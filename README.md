# Evaluating DeepVariant and Conventional SNP Callers in the *Chelonia mydas* Genome Using an Assembly-Derived Truth Set

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository accompanies the research study **“Evaluating DeepVariant and Conventional SNP Callers in the *Chelonia mydas* Genome Using an Assembly-Derived Truth Set.”**
The project presents a fully reproducible benchmarking framework for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection in a non-model marine vertebrate using short-read whole-genome sequencing data.

The workflow integrates read preprocessing, de novo genome assembly, assembly quality evaluation, reference-based alignment, variant calling using five tools, assembly-derived truth-set construction and benchmarking with RTG vcfeval.

## 🧬 Study Objectives

* Construct an **assembly-derived SNP truth set** for *Chelonia mydas*
* Benchmark **DeepVariant** against conventional SNP callers (GATK, FreeBayes, VarScan, BCFtools)
* Quantify performance using **precision, recall, F1-score**, and threshold optimization
* Provide a **reproducible pipeline** for variant benchmarking in non-model organisms

## 📊 Key Findings (Summary)

* **ABySS** produced the most contiguous and biologically representative short-read assembly
* **DeepVariant** achieved the highest F1-score without threshold tuning
* **BCFtools** showed the strongest precision at optimized thresholds
* High SNP concordance was observed among DeepVariant, GATK, BCFtools, and VarScan
* Assembly-derived truth sets enable robust benchmarking in species lacking validated variant resources
